<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Mylene Jeannot, I am an engineer, with the heart of an adventurer. I am the happiest when I am outside surrounded by trees, mountains or the ocean. I love to explore new places or going back to some of my old favorites close to home. I find joy in the simplicity of life. I like to live a minimalist life unemcunber from the unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
I love to be out of my comfort zone. I particularly appreciate the feeling of freedom coming from having everything I need in my backpack and being to go anywhere I want.
